# Googlish Datetime Picker
*Updates to documentation and usage are underway*
A highly customizable Android ViewGroup that allows you to choose a date and time... similar to the picker in Google Calendar. This is a widget that I had made for one of my personal applications that I had decided to make open-source :D
